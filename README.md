#### Requirements:
Before running WL_Fooker, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

-   Windows 7 / 8 / 8.1 / 10 / Server editions.

-   Admin privileges (required for activation routines).

-   Internet connection (optional, for genuine KMS server mode).

## Development requirements:

-   GNU/GCC Compiler (if compiling from source).

-   Windows SDK (for Windows-specific builds).

-   A text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Eclipse CDT).

## How to Use/Installation:

Supported Operating Systems:

 | S.O.  | Version |
 | ----- | --- |
 | Windows  | [**7,8,vista,10**](#windows)  |



-   ## Windows
Basically Download the zip file, or clone the repository via the git bash promt.
1) Clone the repository:

bash
```bash
#!/bin/bash
git clone https://github.com/username/WL_Fooker.git
cd WL_Fooker

```
2) Compile the Program:

bash
```bash
g++ WL_Fooker.cpp -o WL_Fooker.exe
```

3) Run the Program:

-   Execute the .exe file from the "bin" folder (after compiling it from the source code, of course...) or just run it from the command prompt.
```bash
cd bin
./WL_Fooker.exe
```


## How It Works
WL_F00ker emulates the behavior of an internal Key Management Service server, generating valid responses to Windows activation requests. The tool communicates with the Windows Software Protection Platform via the slmgr utility or native API calls, tricking the system into accepting the activation as genuine. This enables seamless unlocking of Windows features without requiring a retail product key.

## Note
 - This tool is intended for educational purposes and system administrators testing deployment setups.

- Misuse of this software may violate the Microsoft EULA.

- Always ensure compliance with licensing policies when using any activation tool.
